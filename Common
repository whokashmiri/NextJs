  -Main Features

  1. Routing (In build )
     Routing in Next.js is how your application handles different pages based on the URL. It is file-based, meaning the structure of your project’s pages/ folder determines the routes of your website.

  2. Rendering
     Rendering in Next.js refers to how your pages and components generate and display content in the browser. Next.js offers different rendering methods to improve performance and SEO.
  3. Data Fetching
     Next.js provides different ways to fetch data depending on your use case. The method you choose affects performance, SEO, and user experience.

Which Data Fetching Method Should You Use?
Use Case -> Best Data Fetching Method
Static content (blogs, docs) -> SSG (getStaticProps)
Real-time updates (stock, dashboards) -> SSR (getServerSideProps)
Frequently updated static content (news, products)-> ISR (getStaticProps + revalidate)
User-specific content (dashboard, profile)-> CSR (useEffect)
Secure API requests (database, authentication)-> API Routes (pages/api/)

Final Thoughts
🔹 SSG (Fastest, best for SEO, static content).
🔹 SSR (Fresh data on every request, slower than SSG).
🔹 ISR (SSG + automatic updates, best for news sites).
🔹 CSR (Client-side, good for user-specific data, but not SEO-friendly).
🔹 API Routes (Build custom APIs inside Next.js).

-Server Components
By Default Every component is Server component, that means if you console.log by default it will only in the server side not client side ( browser)
